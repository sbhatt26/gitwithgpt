# Architecture Overview

The `test.py` file is designed to implement a deep learning-based speech recognition model using PyTorch and torchaudio. The model processes audio input, applies transformations to convert audio signals into spectrograms, and then feeds the processed data through a series of neural network layers including CNNs and bidirectional GRUs to recognize and transcribe speech. The script also includes error rate calculations (WER and CER) and functions for training and evaluating the model.

## Key Components

### Classes
- **TextTransform**
  - Maps characters to integers and vice versa, facilitating the translation between text and integer representations.
- **CNNLayerNorm(nn.Module)**
  - Implements layer normalization specifically designed for CNNs.
- **ResidualCNN(nn.Module)**
  - Implements a residual CNN block with layer normalization and dropout, inspired by a modified ResNet architecture.
- **BidirectionalGRU(nn.Module)**
  - Encapsulates a single layer bidirectional GRU with layer normalization and dropout.
- **SpeechRecognitionModel(nn.Module)**
  - Comprises CNN layers for feature extraction, followed by residual CNN and bidirectional GRU layers, and concludes with a classifier for speech-to-text transformation.
- **IterMeter**
  - Keeps track of the total number of iterations for training monitoring.

### Functions
- **avg_wer(wer_scores, combined_ref_len)**
  - Computes the average word error rate.
- **_levenshtein_distance(ref, hyp)**
  - Calculates the Levenshtein distance, a measure of the difference between two sequences.
- **word_errors(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, delimiter=' ')**
  - Computes Levenshtein distance and the number of words in the reference at the word level.
- **char_errors(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, remove_space=False)**
  - Computes Levenshtein distance and the length of the reference sentence at the character level.
- **wer(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, delimiter=' ')**
  - Calculates the word error rate using word-level Levenshtein distance.
- **cer(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, remove_space=False)**
  - Calculates the character error rate using character-level Levenshtein distance.
- **data_processing(data, data_type="train")**
  - Handles data preprocessing by converting raw audio inputs into spectrograms and maps text to integers for training/validation.
- **GreedyDecoder(output, labels, label_lengths, blank_label=28, collapse_repeated=True)**
  - Implements a greedy decoding process to convert model output into readable text.
- **train(...)**
  - Conducts model training, processing batches of data through the model and updating weights to minimize loss.
- **test(...)**
  - Evaluates the model on a test dataset, calculating and printing the average loss, CER, and WER.
- **checkpoint(model, optimizer, epoch, filename)**
  - Saves a checkpoint containing the model state, optimizer state, and epoch number.
- **main(learning_rate=5e-4, batch_size=20, epochs=3, train_url="train-clean-100", test_url="test-clean", save_model_path="model_checkpoints")**
  - The main entry point to train and test the speech recognition model. Initializes datasets, loaders, model, and runs the training/testing loop.

# Detailed Explanation

This section delves into the operation and purpose of each part of the code, offering a comprehensive look at how various components of the speech recognition system are constructed and interact.

### Text Processing
- **TextTransform Class:** This utility class converts between text and integer sequences. Characters are mapped to unique integers, facilitating the model's training on speech to text tasks.

### Data Processing
- **data_processing Function:** This function transforms input data by generating spectrograms (frequency-time representations of audio) and corresponding integer-encoded text labels. It normalizes whether the data is for training or validation by choosing appropriate transformations.

### Neural Network Architecture
- **CNNLayerNorm and ResidualCNN Classes:** Normalize convolutional layers to standardize input across the batch. Residual CNN blocks conduct complex feature extraction, crucial for processing and understanding audio signals.
- **BidirectionalGRU Class:** Processes sequences bidirectionally allowing context from before and after each point in the sequence, enhancing the transcription accuracy through recurrent layers.

### Model Evaluation
- **Word and Character Error Rates:** Functions like `wer` and `cer` measure the performance in terms of transcription accuracy, leveraging Levenshtein distance for both word and character levels.

### Model Training
- **Training and Testing Functions:** They encapsulate the logic for iterating over epochs, adjusting model weights, validating performance at each epoch, and checkpointing.

### Experimentation Controls
- **IterMeter and main Functions:** Keep track of iteration counts for fine-grain training control and coordinate the dataset loading and model training processes, respectively.

This well-structured and comprehensive code equips a speech recognition system for efficient training, evaluation, and inference on speech recognition tasks using PyTorch, supporting modular adjustments and scalability for different datasets and configurations.
