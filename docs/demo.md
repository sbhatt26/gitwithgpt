# Architecture Overview

This Python script implements a speech recognition model using PyTorch and torchaudio. It focuses on processing audio data into transcriptions using a deep learning architecture with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The script performs data processing, model training, evaluates the model for character and word error rates, and handles checkpoints during the training process.

## Key Components

- **`TextTransform` Class**: Maps characters to integers and vice versa using a predefined character map.
- **Data Processing Functions**: `data_processing` transforms raw audio data into spectrograms and prepares transcription labels.
- **Speech Recognition Model**: Built using CNN layers for feature extraction, residual connections, bidirectional GRUs for sequential data, and a linear classifier.
- **Train and Test Functions**: `train` and `test` handle the training and evaluation of the model, including logging losses and calculating error rates.
- **Checkpoint Function**: Saves the state of the model and optimizer at specified intervals.

# Detailed Explanation

## 1. Function Definitions

### `avg_wer(wer_scores, combined_ref_len)`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `wer_scores`: List of word error rates.
  - `combined_ref_len`: Total number of words in reference data.
- **Purpose**: Computes the average word error rate.

### `_levenshtein_distance(ref, hyp)`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `ref`: Reference string.
  - `hyp`: Hypothesis string.
- **Purpose**: Calculates Levenshtein distance, a metric for measuring edit differences between sequences.

### `word_errors(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, delimiter=' ')`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `reference`, `hypothesis`: Sentences to compare.
  - `ignore_case`, `delimiter`: Optional boolean and delimiter.
- **Purpose**: Computes word-level Levenshtein distance and reference word count.

### `char_errors(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, remove_space=False)`
- **Parameters**: 
  - Similar to `word_errors`, but character-level.
- **Purpose**: Computes character-level Levenshtein distance and reference length.

### `wer(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, delimiter=' ')`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the Word Error Rate (WER).

### `cer(reference, hypothesis, ignore_case=False, remove_space=False)`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the Character Error Rate (CER).

## 2. Class Definitions

### `TextTransform`
- **Purpose**: Provides mapping between characters and integers for encoding and decoding text.

### `CNNLayerNorm` (subclass of `nn.Module`)
- **Purpose**: Implements layer normalization for CNN inputs.

### `ResidualCNN` (subclass of `nn.Module`)
- **Purpose**: Implements a residual CNN block with layer normalization and dropout.

### `BidirectionalGRU` (subclass of `nn.Module`)
- **Purpose**: Implements a Bidirectional GRU layer with normalization and dropout.

### `SpeechRecognitionModel` (subclass of `nn.Module`)
- **Constructor**: Initializes feature extraction and classification layers with configurable parameters for CNN and RNN layers.
- **`forward(x)`**: Defines the forward pass for the model.

## 3. Training and Evaluation Functions

### `train(...)`
- **Parameters**: Model, device, data loaders, loss criterion, optimizer, learning rate scheduler, epoch, iteration counter.
- **Purpose**: Executes training for an epoch and logs training losses.

### `test(...)`
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the trained model on a test set, calculates loss, CER, and WER.

### `main(...)`
- **Purpose**: Sets up data, initializes the model, optimizer, and scheduler, and runs the training and evaluation loops. It saves model checkpoints and plots training/validation metrics.

## 4. Execution

- The `main` function runs with specified hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, utilizing the LibriSpeech dataset for training and testing the speech recognition model.
